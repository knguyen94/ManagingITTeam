# Executive Summary

## Problem:

With the use of open source software and having involvement in open source, some problems arise and many risks are involved. These problems exist because developers are often bringing in code from external resources into the organization and there are very few if any checks on these external sources. Not checking this information from external sources can result in issues and inconsistencies that can create risk for the organization. These problems can be solved by performing vulnerability testing. Any software created internally would go through some form of vulnerability testing but software created externally often don't receive this treatment. The external sources may have never gone through vulnerability testing. The problem with vulnerability testing is that it requires time for someone or people to do the testing and it requires resources to perform.   


## Solution: 

To combat this issue vulnerability checks should be automated. Vulnerability checks can be automated and don't have to take up much time or resources. There are a lot of different softwares that are for automated vulnerability checks. A lot of the more basic tools are free and some of the more intensive applications are paid. These applications run on most operating systems and are great tools for many organizations because they can save time and money.
