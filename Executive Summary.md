Executive Summary

Problem:

With the use of open source software and having involvement in open source, some problems arise and risk is also involved. These problems exist becasue developers are often bring in code from external resources into the organizaton andnd there are very few if any checks on these external soruces. Not checking this information from external sources can result in issues and inconsistentcies that can create risk for the orginazation. These problem can be solved by performing vunerabillity testing. Any sofware created internally would go through some form of vunerabillity testing but software created externally often don't recieve this treatment. And the external sources may have never gone through vulnerabillity testing. The problem with vulnerabillity testsing is that it requires time for someone or people  to do the testing and it requires resources to perform.   


Solution: 

To combat this issue vulnerability checks should be automated. Vulnerability checks can be automated and doesn't have to take up much time or resources. Doing this internally will help to better guard against future risks and other issues. Doing these checks internally will help push the best product possible.
