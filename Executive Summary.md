Executive Summary

Problem:

With the use of open source software and having involvement in open source, some problems arise and risk is also involved.
One problem is vulnerability testing. On the internal side of things vulnerability testing is easier because the 
testing us usually done by those inside the company ensuring the testing is done. It is easy to assign people or 
person to do the testing and there is some form of accountability. With the intake of external software there are 
more variable to worry about. With external testing you may or may not know if the testing was done or how through it
was. To minimize risk, the testing must be done internally. The problem with this is that doing this requires 
resources and time. Other problems software licensing issues.

Solution: 
	
To combat this issue vulnerability checks should be done internally. Vulnerability checks can be automated so
it doesnâ€™t have to take up much time or resources. Doing this internally will help better guard against future risks 
and other issues. And will help push the best product possible.
