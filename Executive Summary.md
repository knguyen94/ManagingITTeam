Executive Summary

Problem:

There are many issues out with software today. THere are many vurnerabitilies with software as we have seen with the scans that have been done. As a person understanding what dgoes on with software there must be a tolerance from what is allowed to be pushed and used.

Solution:

Research and well documented applications may be the only things that should be pushed. Using external software is a risk but must happen at times to get a product through. To better defend a company internal software should be developed to safe guard issues that may arise.
